/**
 * A class that handles the bundled BusyBox.
 * <p>
 * {@code libsu} bundles with busybox binaries for both arm and x86 (arm64 and x64 are also covered).
 * Developers using {@code libsu} can easily access busybox applets by calling {@link #setup(Context)}
 * before any new shell is created (place this in the same place where you call
 * {@link Shell#setFlags(int)}) and {@link Shell#setInitializer(Shell.Initializer)}.
 * After calling {@link #setup(Context)}, busybox will be installed in the app's internal storage,
 * and all new shells created will have the path to busybox <b>prepended</b> to {@code PATH}.
 * This makes sure all commands are using the applets from busybox, providing predictable
 * behavior so that developers can have less headache handling different implementation of the
 * common shell utilities. Some operations in {@link com.topjohnwu.superuser.io} depends on a
 * busybox to work properly, check before using them.
 * <p>
 * Note: the busybox binaries will add around 1.6MB to your APK, for developers not willing
 * to use the busybox binaries bundled in {@code libsu}, you can use proguard to remove it:
 * remember to <b>NOT</b> call {@link #setup(Context)} anywhere in your code, and enable both
 * <b>minifyEnabled</b> and <b>shrinkResources</b> in your release builds. For more info, please
 * check <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html">the official documentation</a>.
